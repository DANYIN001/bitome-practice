Analysis of binarized genome-scale feature information for E. coli K-12 MG1655


Organizes base pair-centered information for a bacterial genome (using E. coli K-12 MG1655 as an example).

Enables linking of features and preparation of binary matrix representing genome information.

See notebooks folder for example workflows.
